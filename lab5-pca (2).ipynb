    "# Lab 5: Principal components\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many perspectives on principal components analysis (PCA). PCA is variously described as: a dimension reduction method; a method of approximating covariance structure; a latent model; a change of basis that optimally describes covariation; and so on. How can these seemingly distinct views be compatible with a single method?\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple answer is that PCA has a very wide range of applications in which it serves different purposes. Sometimes it is applied to find a few derived variables based on a large number of input variables -- hence, 'dimension reduction'. At others, it is used to interpret covariation among many variables -- hence, a 'covariance approximation'. With different objectives come different perspectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "In PSTAT100, we'll try to look beyond this and focus on the core technique of PCA: *finding linear data transformations that preserve variation and covariation*. In short, we'll focus on the *principal components* (PC) part of PCA, taking the following view.\n",
    "* **Principal components** are _**linear data transformations**_. \n",
    "* The **analysis** of principal components is _**varied depending on the application**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep an open mind for the time being about what the analysis (A) part of PCA entails. So, what does it mean to say that 'principal components are linear data transformations'? Suppose you have a dataset with $n$ observations and $p$ variables. As a dataframe, this might look something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation | Variable 1 | Variable 2 | $\\cdots$ | Variable $p$\n",
    "---|---|---|---|---\n",
    "1 | $x_{11}$ | $x_{12}$ | $\\cdots$ | $x_{1p}$\n",
    "2 | $x_{21}$ | $x_{22}$ | $\\cdots$ | $x_{2p}$\n",
    "$\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ |  | $\\vdots$\n",
    "$n$ | $x_{n1}$ | $x_{n2}$ | $\\cdots$ | $x_{np}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent the values as a data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ with $n$ rows and $p$ columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{X} \n",
    "= \\underbrace{\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "    \\mathbf{x}_1 &\\mathbf{x}_2 &\\cdots &\\mathbf{x}_p\n",
    "    \\end{array}\\right]}_{\\text{column vectors}}\n",
    "= \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "    x_{11} &x_{12} &\\cdots &x_{1p} \\\\\n",
    "    x_{21} &x_{22} &\\cdots &x_{2p} \\\\\n",
    "    \\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "    x_{n1} &x_{n2} &\\cdots &x_{np}\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To say that the principal components are linear data transformations means that each principal component is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PC} = \\mathbf{Xv} = v_1 \\mathbf{x}_1 + v_2 \\mathbf{x}_2 + \\cdots + v_p \\mathbf{x}_p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a linear combination of the columns of the data matrix. In PCA, the linear combination coefficients are known as *loadings*; the PC loadings are found in a particular way using the correlations among the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll focus on computing and interpreting principal components:\n",
    "* finding the loadings (linear combination coefficients) for each PC;\n",
    "* quantifying the variation captured by each PC;\n",
    "* visualization-based techniques for selecting a number of PC's to A(nalyze);\n",
    "* plotting and interpreting loadings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you'll encounter a few ways that PCA is useful in exploratory analysis:\n",
    "* describing variation and covariation;\n",
    "* identifying variables that 'drive' variation and covariation;\n",
    "* visualizing multivariate data.\n",
    "\n",
